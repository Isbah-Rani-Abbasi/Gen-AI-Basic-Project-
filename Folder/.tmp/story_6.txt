Title: Lakeshore

There’s birdsong in the trees but all I can hear is the water licking at the lakeshore. Smoothed pebbles clink together in the soft wake. A distant breeze creases the glassy surface on the other side. Beyond that lies the shoulder of the forested mountain that now sheathes the sun. The water is obsidian in the dimness, deep and sharply cold – though I've never been in – yet I know it must be freezing. I know because the flesh rising on my arms tells me so. I hear scraping and turn around to see Emma, cradling our baby in one arm, scooping up a rock. She winds up to toss it into the lake and I scramble towards her, shaking my head and telling her no. She scrunches her face and lets it tumble towards  the ground, clattering onto the stones. I shoot Dad a bewildered look but he keeps on shaking his head at me. We don’t disturb the water, he mutters. We don’t break the surface. My face burns and I break his stare. Later, we warm up around the fire which paints our little tents orange. He’s still quiet, quiet as the moment we arrived, and again I wonder why he brought us at all. Why we have a tent each. Silently he shovels pebbles onto the fire and points me towards my tent and silently I shuffle in. In the dark, submerged in silence, I hear the tide playing against the stones. And maybe it’s just an illusion informed by a child’s penchant for fantasy but I hear a rock clatter and something slide into the depths.  In the morning, Dad’s clothes hang over the fire.  I put Emma to bed at dark. Again she asks me why we’re sleeping separately tonight. Why we’re here at all. I say goodnight and kiss the baby on the head and zip up her tent door.  I sit by the entrance listening to her breathing until I’m sure she’s asleep. Then I start towards the water.     submitted by    /u/whalespeech   [link]   [comments]
