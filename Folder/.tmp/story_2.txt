Title: Bedrideen

I’ve been in this bed as long as I can recall. I will die in this bed. I have a terrible illness that keeps me confined. I will not go into detail.  When I was young I was placed in front of my bedroom window. My only saving grace.  There is a neighbor boy, who is the around the same age as me. Our bedroom windows face each other.  When we were boys I would watch him play and imagine I was playing too. I watched him learn to ride a bike from my window.  He went to middle school, and then high school. In my bed I remained.  We both grew up, but I did not experience life in the same way.  I watched him do his homework, watch tv, and talk on the phone.  He drove home in his first car. He was so excited. I felt proud, I wondered what it was like to drive.  He graduated both high school and college. I watched him and his family and friends celebrate in the yard. He was getting ready to move out. I wouldn’t know what that was like.  But then.  One night I watched the ambulance come and take him away. I waited for weeks. I didn’t know what happened.  Finally the ambulance came back. They took him out.  They wheeled him into his bedroom. The one he grew up in. The one he was so eager to leave. To see the world.  The men placed his bed directly in front of his window. Just like mine.  Two bedridden boys. We stared at each other. A tear wet my cheek.  He would have nothing to watch.     submitted by    /u/tcoriston93   [link]   [comments]
