Title: Winter Flies

The first fly appeared in winter. That was the wrongness of it. Outside, snow swallowed the world whole. Half a meter of silence, ice locked into place. Inside, there was heat, breath, human warmth—and a fly, tracing lazy circles near the ceiling as if it belonged there. I didn’t panic. Flies follow people. They always have. I assumed it came in with groceries, or clung to a sleeve. I let it live. Killing it felt unnecessary, almost rude. Days passed. Another fly. Then another. Not an infestation—nothing dramatic. Just enough to notice. Enough to feel watched. They hovered without urgency, never frantic, never trapped. Waiting. We kept things clean. No pets. No standing water. My plants were cacti, dry as bone. Still, one morning I found something outside the garage: metal objects arranged carefully into a triangle, and at the center, a round glassy thing that caught the light like an eye. I stared at it longer than I meant to. I felt foolish afterward. It meant nothing. The flies multiplied quietly. I removed the plants. Called an exterminator. He spoke gently, like a man explaining death to a child. “Two weeks,” he said. “They’ll be gone.” I wanted to believe him. Two weeks passed. They stayed. Winter broke. Spring arrived. The flies did not leave. No one could explain it. Specialists shrugged. I stopped asking. Some problems resist language. Then a dog barked at me—furious, panicked. Its owner apologized. “He only does that when something’s wrong.” I stepped away and the dog fell silent, eyes locked on me until I was gone. After that, I noticed patterns. Animals avoided me. Flinched. Watched. I remembered reading, once, that dogs could smell disease. I laughed it off. Urban myth. The hospital did not laugh. The diagnosis came wrapped in careful phrasing, sterile hands, eyes that never quite met mine. I nodded. I understood. Too late. That night, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror and finally looked. My breath was sour, unmistakably wrong. My gums dark. My skin waxy, stretched thin over bone, yellowed like old paper. Patches of dryness flaked away when I touched my face. My hair shone with an unnatural grease. My eyes—dull, retreating. I leaned closer. I smelled it then. Sweet. Rotting. Meat left out too long. Everyone had seen it. They must have. The coworkers who smiled. The friends who hugged me. The strangers who stepped back without knowing why. All of them polite. All of them silent. The flies landed on my reflection. They had never been lost. They had been early. And in the end, they were the only ones honest enough to stay.    submitted by    /u/razhielin   [link]   [comments]
